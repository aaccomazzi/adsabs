jQuery UI version 1.10.2

Selected only slider widget (plus whatever is required by the core) 
because other widgets create conflict with the one from twitter bootstrap

Alex H: I upgraded to 1.10.3 and added the autocomplete widget (which comes with menu widget) because I'm using it instead of the bootstrap autocomplete)
