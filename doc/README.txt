We have agreed that all documentation is inside the source code.
We don't know yet which engine to use, there were two options
 - Sphingx (the most popular, used by Python website, Flask itself)
 - ????

This folder should contain automatically generated documentation.

Plus perhaps what doesn't fit inside the source code, ie. outline
of the modules, links to important docs...
